## Welcome 

Welcome to Eck Sports Lab! 

At Eck Sports Lab, our mission is to research all things sports with a current focus on baseball. We study topics ranging from player evaluation metrics to comparing baseball players across eras. The common thread linking all of our projects is a dedication to high-quality and often innovative statistical and interdisciplinary research with a focus on an accessible and entertaining presentation of our ideas.

## Current Projects 

**Comparing baseball players across eras** - This is an ongoing project devoted to the development of statistical tools which can era-adjust performance metrics. The impetus for this project was the initial discovery that the current consensus of baseball ranking methods were biased towards the performance of pre-integration players. You can read more about these origins [here](https://deck13.shinyapps.io/challenging_baseball_nostalgia/?_ga=2.63424943.1066016428.1662040173-852280612.1656705949). Recently, we have made an advance towards the creation of era-adjusted statistics with the development of what we call [Full House Modeling](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-19/issue-2/Comparing-baseball-players-across-eras-via-novel-Full-House-Modeling/10.1214/24-AOAS1992.short). Full House Models era-adjust statistics through a principled balancing of how players performed "vs. their peers" and the quality of the talent pool of players' contemporaries.

Here is a snapshot of our current results. Below is the top 10 list according to era-adjusted baseball reference wins above replacement (ebWAR) and era-adjusted fangraphs wins above replacement (efWAR):

rank | name | ebWAR | name | efWAR
| -- | ------- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
1  | Barry Bonds	| 154.71 | Barry Bonds	  | 145.57
2  | Willie Mays	| 145.30 | Roger Clemens  | 140.75
3  | Roger Clemens	| 144.38 | Willie Mays	  | 135.78
4  | Babe Ruth		| 138.64 | Henry Aaron	  | 127.96
5  | Henry Aaron	| 135.67 | Greg Maddux	  | 120.91
6  | Alex Rodriguez	| 120.64 | Babe Ruth	  | 120.6
7  | Stan Musial	| 119.37 | Stan Musial	  | 112.79
8  | Ty Cobb		| 115    | Alex Rodriguez | 110.52
9  | Greg Maddux	| 113.55 | Randy Johnson  | 109.78
10 | Albert Pujols	| 111.95 | Ty Cobb	  | 108.95

*The list above combines Babe Ruth's batting and pitching WAR*

**SEAM method for better batted-ball prediction** - We developed SEAM (synthetic estimated average matchup) methodology for describing batter versus pitcher matchups in baseball. The SEAM method provides confidence regions that reflect where baseballs that are put into play are expected to land. Our method is more accurate than similar methods constructed from individual batter spray charts or an individual pitcher's spray chart allowed. We estimate that the implementation of SEAM can yield an additional 40 outs over conventional spray charts throughout the course of an MLB season. We have developed a [web application](https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/index.html) that implements the SEAM method and provides visualizations. 

Check out Julia Wapner's presentation of the SEAM method at the 2022 SABR Analytics Conference:
