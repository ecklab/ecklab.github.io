## Welcome 

Welcome to the Eck research lab. At Eck lab we are devoted to the understanding of all things baseball. 


## Current projects 

**Comparing baseball players across eras** - This is an ongoing project devoted to the development of statistical tools which can era-adjust performance metrics. The impetus for this project was the initial discovery that the current consensus of baseball ranking methods were biased towards the performance of pre-integration players. You can read more about these origins [here](https://deck13.shinyapps.io/challenging_baseball_nostalgia/?_ga=2.63424943.1066016428.1662040173-852280612.1656705949). Recently, we have made an advance towards the development of era-adjusted statistics with the development of what we call the [Full House Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11332). The Full House Model era-adjusts statistics through a principled balancing of how players performed "vs. their peers" and the quality of the talent pool of players' contemporaries.

Here is a snapshot of our current results. Below is the top 10 list according to era-adjusted baseball reference wins above replacment (ebWAR) and era-adjusted fangraphs wins above replacment (efWAR):

rank | name | ebWAR | name | efWAR
| -- | ------- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
1  | Barry Bonds      | 154.80 | Barry Bonds      | 152.69
2  | Willie Mays      | 145.47 | Willie Mays      | 138.04
3  | Roger Clemens    | 141.33 | Roger Clemens    | 131.19
4  | Hank Aaron       | 129.65 | Hank Aaron       | 125.00
5  | Babe Ruth        | 122.77 | Babe Ruth        | 119.16
6  | Alex Rodriguez   | 121.01 | Alex Rodriguez   | 116.66
7  | Greg Maddux      | 111.60 | Greg Maddux      | 115.28
8  | Albert Pujols    | 111.03 | Mike Schmidt     | 107.80
9  | Mike Schmidt     | 110.43 | Rickey Henderson | 106.86
10 | Rickey Henderson | 107.79 | Nolan Ryan       | 105.24



**SEAM method** - We develop the SEAM (synthetic estimated average matchup) method for describing batter versus pitcher matchups in baseball. The SEAM method provides confidence regions that reflect where baseballs that are put into play are expected to land. Our method is more accurate than similar methods constructed from individual batter spracy charts or an individual pitcher's spray chart allowed. We estimate that the implementation of SEAM can yield an additional 40 outs over conventional spray charts throughout the course of an MLB season. We have developed a [web applciation](https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/index.html) that implements the SEAM method and provides visualizations. 

Check out Julia Wapner's presentation of the SEAM method at the 2022 SABR Analytics Conference:
